**Alo Yoga Interactive Store Locator: Case Study**

**1. Executive Summary**

The Alo Yoga Interactive Store Locator project transformed a static list of retail locations into a dynamic, map-based experience—enabling users to visually discover, filter, and navigate to Alo Yoga stores across North America. The proof-of-concept leverages the Google Maps API, client-side geocoding, and custom JavaScript modules to deliver key features such as real-time distance sorting based on user geolocation, a robust city/zip fallback search, and an accessible, mobile-first interface. Within the PoC, over 200 store locations were geocoded and rendered with interactive custom markers and InfoWindows, all within a clean, brand-aligned design. The outcome demonstrates both technical feasibility for a production rollout and a significant uplift in user discoverability and engagement potential compared to the original static list.

**2. Problem Statement & Objectives**

**Problem Statement:**
Alo Yoga's website historically presented its retail locations as a simple, static list—forcing users to scroll through hundreds of entries to find a store near them. This format made it difficult to:

- Visually understand store distribution and proximity.
- Quickly identify the closest or most convenient location.
- Navigate to store details without leaving the context of the list.
- Access an optimized experience on mobile devices, where long lists are cumbersome to scroll.

**Objectives:**
- **Improve Discoverability:** Provide a visual interface that maps all store locations and highlights those nearest to the user.
- **Enhance Mobile Experience:** Design a responsive UI that seamlessly toggles between list and map views, optimized for touch interactions.
- **Streamline Navigation:** Enable users to click directly on map markers or list items to view store details and obtain directions.
- **Maintain Brand Alignment:** Implement a design consistent with Alo Yoga's clean, modern aesthetic, using custom map styling and typography.
- **Ensure Performance & Maintainability:** Build a modular codebase under file size limits, avoiding unnecessary dependencies and ensuring ease of future enhancements.

**3. Solution Overview**

We developed a proof-of-concept (PoC) that transforms raw store data from Alo Yoga's website into an interactive, map-based interface. The process began with using the Firecrawl MCP server to crawl the live store pages state-by-state (US, Canada, Mexico), extracting key store details and converting them into a consolidated JSON dataset. This data serves as the single source of truth for the map visualization and client-side filtering.

The PoC runs entirely in the browser using Vanilla JavaScript, leveraging modular architecture for maintainability and future extensibility. By integrating Google Maps and custom client-side logic, users can seamlessly explore store locations, sort by proximity, and interact with custom map markers—all within a cohesive, brand-aligned UI.

**Key Features:**
- **Data-Driven Visualization:** Raw HTML is crawled and structured into JSON, then loaded at runtime to populate the map and store list.
- **Geolocation & Proximity Sorting:** Upon page load, the app requests user geolocation, calculates distances via the Haversine formula, and sorts stores nearest-first.
- **Fallback City/Zip Search:** Users can input a city or ZIP code; the input is geocoded, and if no stores appear in the viewport, the five closest stores to the searched location are displayed along with an adjusted map view.
- **Real-Time Open/Closed Status:** Each store displays current open/closed status based on structured hours data; InfoWindows also indicate when the store will next open or close.
- **Custom Map Styling & Controls:** Tailored Google Maps styles minimize visual clutter, with selective suppression of POI labels and optimized gesture handling for mobile.
- **Responsive Mobile UI:** A split-view desktop layout transitions to a stacked mobile view with a clear List/Map toggle, ensuring usability on all devices.
- **Interactive Markers & InfoWindows:** The `AloPinOverlay` class renders bespoke SVG markers—original and inverted variants generated via ChatGPT design prompts—converted to static assets and animated on hover with smooth scale and rotation transitions. Selecting a marker or list item opens a styled InfoWindow displaying store details (name, hours), clickable address and phone links, and distance information.
- **Modular Codebase:** Distinct modules for configuration, map management, data handling, UI rendering, and application orchestration promote clean separation of concerns and future scalability.

**4. Technical Implementation**

**4.1 Architecture & Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Maps & Geocoding:** Google Maps JavaScript API v3, Google Maps Geocoding API
- **Data Format:** JSON master files (`allStoresData`)
- **Scripting:** Python 3.13 for batch geocoding (`scripts/geocode_stores.py`)
- **Hosting:** Local HTTP server (`python3 -m http.server`) for development; Vercel for PoC deployment

**4.2 Module Breakdown**
- `config.js`: Central settings (API keys, map style definitions, SVG asset references)
- `aloPinOverlay.js`: Custom `OverlayView` subclass
  - ChatGPT-prompted design of white and inverted-black SVG pins
  - Conversion to static assets
  - Hover animation logic (scale + Y‑axis rotation, face swap)
- `mapManager.js`: Map initialization, management of overlays and InfoWindows
- `storeManager.js`: Fetching JSON data, geocoding fallback search, filtering by bounds or proximity
- `uiManager.js`: Dynamic DOM rendering of store list, search input handling, mobile toggle logic
- `app.js`: Top‑level orchestrator coordinating modules on load and user interactions

**4.3 Data Handling & Geocoding**
- **Crawling & Extraction:** Firecrawl MCP server performed state-by-state crawl of Alo Yoga's store pages (US, CA, MX).
- **JSON Transformation:** Raw HTML parsed into structured JSON files (`all_us_stores.json`, `all_ca_stores.json`, `all_mx_stores.json`) and merged into `allStoresData`.
- **Batch Geocoding:** Python script iteratively called the Geocoding API to append `latitude`/`longitude`, with errors logged to `geocode_errors.log`.
- **Distance Computation:** Client‑side Haversine formula implementation for real-time proximity sorting.

**4.4 Development Workflow & Tooling**
- **Cursor AI Code Editor:** Used as the primary development environment—leveraging prompt‑based assistance for code generation, refactoring, and asset creation (SVG conversion, CSS snippets).
- **Terminal Integration:** Executed server commands, linting, and Git version control directly within the Cursor agent window for transparency.
- **Modular CI/CD:** PoC deployed to Vercel via GitHub integration; environment restrictions configured for API key safety.
- **Local Testing:** Employed live-reload and manual QA across desktop and mobile simulators to verify responsiveness and map interactivity.

**4.5 UI/UX Details**
- **Desktop Layout:** Split-screen view with a 60/40 store list/map ratio, sticky header and map.
- **Mobile Layout:** Stacked panels (list above map) with a full-width toggle bar.
- **Single‑Finger Map Control:** Enabled `gestureHandling: 'greedy'` on mobile to allow intuitive one-finger panning without zoom conflicts.
- **Custom InfoWindows:** Brand‑aligned card design with SVG icons for location, clock, and phone; clickable links for navigation (`tel:` and Apple/Google Maps).
- **Map Styling:** Suppressed text labels for POIs and transit; retained iconography for contextual cues; removed default map-type toggle.
- **Accessibility:** ARIA attributes on interactive elements; keyboard focus states; high-contrast text over map overlays.

**5. Challenges & Solutions**
- **CORS & Local Data Loading:** Serving JSON files locally required a Python HTTP server to satisfy browser CORS policies for `fetch` requests.
- **Mobile Gesture Conflicts:** Initial map panning interfered with page scrolling; solved by setting `gestureHandling: 'greedy'` for one-finger control.
- **Performance Optimization:** Implemented lazy-loading of markers within map bounds and modular code splitting to keep file sizes under 300 lines.
- **API Security:** Secured Google Maps API keys with HTTP referrer restrictions in the Google Cloud Console; environment-specific key management prevents exposure in public repos.
- **Brand Consistency:** Enforced strict adherence to Alo Yoga's brand guidelines within PoC constraints by customizing map styles and SVG assets.
